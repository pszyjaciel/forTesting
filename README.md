### Projects
Actually only three of my dotNet-projects are listed here. </br>
The two of them are used in the daylight. The others are not deployed yet. </br>
However I work hard to finish the PCB-merger.

- the MDI Viewer
- the Stack-up viewer (myDataSet2)
- the PCB Merger

### Technology
- The MDI Viewer is pure dotNet project based on Windows Forms 
with network functionality. </br>

- The core of the Stack-up viewer is the <b>Oracle client</b> fetching the data from 
an Oracle v8.1 database and displaying it in a Windows Forms GUI. </br>

- The PCB Merger is a combination of <b>two projects</b>: a .Net GUI display and editor
and a c++ DLL library. </br></br>
